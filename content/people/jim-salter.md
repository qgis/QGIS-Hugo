bio: Jim Salter is an author, public speaker, small business owner, mercenary sysadmin,
  and father of threeâ€”not necessarily in that order. He got his first real taste of
  open source by running Apache on his very own dedicated FreeBSD 3.1 server back
  in 1999, and he's been a fierce advocate of FOSS ever since. He's the author of
  the Sanoidhyperconverged infrastructure project. He's contributed to websites such
  as Ars Technica on everything from Wi-Fi to NAS distributions to next-gen filesystems.
